Integrated a complete "Connect Wallet" feature into a React-based DeFi platform using ethers.js.
• Implemented functionality to connect with MetaMask, fetch and display the user's wallet address, ETH balance, and current network (e.g., Mainnet, Sepolia).
• Ensured a clean user experience by replacing the placeholder UI with a dynamic component that shows wallet details upon connection and provides a disconnect option.
• Handled events like account and network changes gracefully to provide a seamless user interaction.
Technologies: React, TypeScript, ethers.js, Web3
